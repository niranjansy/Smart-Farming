# Smart Farming

This is the website for the Smart Farming application, where we plan to use a web service to automate the management of farms and link it to a seed-planting bot which can automatically plant seeds on farmlands.

This has been proposed by Team Alpha, comprising:
* Aditya C
* Niranjan S Yadiyala
<br> as part of HAC SAC 2020.
